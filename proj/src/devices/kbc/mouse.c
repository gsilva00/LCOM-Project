/* NOTES: 
<About disable_stream_data()>
 - This function is sending the PS2_DATA_DIS command to the mouse. Might separate concerns into another function if need to send another command to the mouse
 - From https://web.archive.org/web/20210708233930/https://www.aquaphoenix.com/hardware/ledlamp/reference/synaptics_touchpad_interfacing_guide.pdf (page 31): 
  - "The device responds within 25ms (25000 Î¼s), unless the host prevents it from doing so by inhibiting the bus."
  - "Each command or argument byte produces at least one response byte from the device.", 
  - "When the host gets an $FE response, it should retry the offending command." - so it continues, to not run the argument part;
  - "If an argument byte elicits an $FE response, the host should retransmit the entire command, not just the argument byte." - then why doesn't it work when I test the ack after both the command and the arguments?
 - This means that both the command and the argument can send an $FE response, so we need to check for both
